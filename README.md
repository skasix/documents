Getting Started
These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

See Deployment to learn how to deploy the project.

Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

Give an example.

Installation
Below is a clear, step-by-step guide to get your development environment up and running. Follow each step carefully, and by the end, you’ll be able to build, test, and run the project on your own machine.

1. Clone the Repository
What to do: Download the source code to your local machine.
Why: This gives you access to the entire project so you can build and run it locally.
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/skasix/
cd yourproject
2. Install Dependencies
What to do: Use Maven to download and install all the necessary libraries and dependencies.
Why: Ensures that your project has everything it needs to compile and run correctly.
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn clean install
3. Run the Application
What to do: Use the built-in server to start the application locally.
Why: This allows you to see the project in action on your machine.
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn exec:java
4. Check the Application
What to do: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.
Why: Verify that the application is up and running.
Example:
You should see the homepage or API endpoint responding.

5. Fetch Data for a Small Demo
What to do: Use curl or your browser to make a sample request.
Why: Demonstrates that your system is providing data correctly.
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://localhost:8080/api/feed
Running the Tests
This project includes automated tests to help ensure that your code works as expected. Here’s how to run them:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn test
End-to-End Tests
What they verify:
End-to-end (E2E) tests check the entire workflow from start to finish. They simulate real user interactions to make sure that all parts of the system work together as intended.

Why they matter:
They help catch integration issues that unit tests might miss.

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn verify -P e2e
This runs the full E2E test suite defined in your project.

Code Style Tests
What they verify:
Code style tests check that your code follows the agreed-upon formatting and style guidelines.

Why they matter:
Consistent code style makes collaboration easier and the codebase more maintainable.

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn checkstyle:check
This runs the Checkstyle plugin and reports any style violations.

Deployment
When you’re ready to deploy:

Build the production version:

bash
Copy
Edit
mvn package
Upload the generated .jar or .war file to your server.

Run it using your preferred web server or container.

Notes:

Make sure your environment variables are set correctly for production.

Use HTTPS and a reverse proxy if needed.

Test the deployed version thoroughly before announcing it live.
